ðŸ“Œ Project Overview: Word2Vec with PCA Visualization
Downloaded a text dataset from Kaggle/web for training purposes.

Preprocessed and tokenized the text, then trained a custom Word2Vec model.

Applied PCA to reduce high-dimensional word vectors to 2D for visualization.

Plotted the 2D embeddings using matplotlib to visualize word relationships.

Used Word2Vec similarity functions to explore and compare similar words.
