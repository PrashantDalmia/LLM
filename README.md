**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview: Word2Vec with PCA Visualization**

1- Downloaded a text dataset from Kaggle/web for training purposes.
2 - Preprocessed and tokenized the text, then trained a custom Word2Vec model.
3 - Applied PCA to reduce high-dimensional word vectors to 2D for visualization.
4 - Plotted the 2D embeddings using matplotlib to visualize word relationships.
5 - Used Word2Vec similarity functions to explore and compare similar words.
